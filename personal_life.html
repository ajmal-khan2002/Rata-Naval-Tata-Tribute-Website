            <p class="text1">Ratan Naval Tata was born on <b>December 28, 1937</b>, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. He is the great-grandson of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. Ratan Tata’s parents, Naval and Sonoo Tata, separated when he was just ten years old, and he was subsequently raised by his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata, in a joint family.
    
                Ratan Tata's personal life is marked by his humility and simplicity. Despite being one of India’s most prominent industrialists, he is known for leading a relatively modest lifestyle. He is an animal lover and has a keen interest in dogs, often seen with his pets.
                
                Ratan Tata attended the Campion School in Mumbai until the 8th grade, followed by the Cathedral and John Connon School, and later the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla. He completed his B.S. in architecture with structural engineering from Cornell University in 1962 and attended the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 1975.
                
                He is known for his bachelor status, having never married, though he once revealed in an interview that he came close to getting married four times, but the circumstances were not favorable.
                
                Ratan Tata’s personal values of integrity, dedication, and philanthropy have deeply influenced his professional life, shaping him into a respected leader and an inspiring figure both in India and internationally.</p>
